The development of the project and the use of github went really well for our group. Firstly, Ruby kindly
made the repository and shared it with the rest of the group. We then made a develop branch from main to
allow us to create our own branches from dev to add features to the project. We later decided to host a
meeting to go over some of the functionality of github and how to create branches, commit, push etc. We all
managed to successfully create our own branches and make our changes. We decided to do our first pull
request from our feature branch to develop on the meeting we had so that everyone could see how it was done
and ask any questions if they had any and it all went well. We assigned ourselves to the PRs and assigned the
rest of our group as reviewers. We commented useful tips on each others prs for any changes that we thought
they should make and then approved the PR when we thought it was ready to be merged to dev. The owner of the
PR then went and merged the branch to dev successfully, allowing the rest of the group to pull the changes
into their local code.
